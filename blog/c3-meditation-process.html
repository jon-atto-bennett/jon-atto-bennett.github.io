          <h4>Thoughts on the Meditation Process</h4>
          <h6>Process over Product</h6>
          <p>
            I understand the process over product concept, by concentrating on following the correct process the product will naturally result. It is like the cliches "one game at a time" or "every journey starts with the first step". However understanding and being able to do are two different things and at this early stage I found my attention focusing on the product, it's not good enough I must be doing it wrong and then I would get lost. The good thing though is that I recognised this and was able to bring myself back to the process. I even saw an improvemnt as I went through the tasks and with practice this will improve and allow me to complete things more quickly and with less stress.
          </p>
          <h6>"Search Inside Yourself" Chapter 2"</h6>
          <p>
            The chapter looked at what meditation is, how to do it and what the benifits are. I have being doing the HeadSpace medatation course online which involves listening to a instructor who takes you through a meditation process for ten minutes each day. The chapter reinforced the online course and explained that meditation is not something difficult and only possible if you are already at a high state of conciousness. Rather it is quite a simple exercise where the benefit comes from practice and attention is put on process rather than product.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results of practicing meditation, such as greater awareness of one's self, better concentration through mindfulness and ultimately increased health and happiness are very desirable goals. The scientific studies referenced in the chapter were very encouraging.
          </p>
          <p>
            The meditation technique that really stood out for me is not to put to much effort into it, but be more accepting of what is going on and just bring the attention gently back to your focus point and the fact that this is an exercise in itself. Focal points can be your breathing, your physical sensations or the sounds and even smells around you, the important thing is just to be aware without being judgemental. Also the importance of realising your intention in the things you do and how that can affect the outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that EDA include emotional intelligence and ways to increase it in the course is fantastic and something I will do my best to benefit from. Hopefully it will be positve both in my new career as a web developer and also my well being in general.
