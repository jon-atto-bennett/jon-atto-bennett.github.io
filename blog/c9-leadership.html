          <h3>Leadership</h3>
          <h4>"Search Inside Yourself" Chapter 8</h4>
          <h6>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h6>
          <p>
            My experience of compassionate leadership is with my manager at my previous job. He joined the company when I was on bereavement leave and on my return could not of been more supportive. It was obvious that he valued personal relationships and showed a genuine interest in not only my situation but those of my colleages who he also managed. He was honest about his strengths and weaknesses and that the important thing was to work as a team to achieve our goals. He had realistic expectations and was happy to give credit for good work. We got to know him not only in the work environment but outside as well and I still consider him as a friend even though we no longer work together.
          </p>
          <h6>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h6>
          <p>
            I found it heartening to do, it certainly gives a good feeling. I have only had the chance to do it once so far but will definetly include it in my meditation kit bag and hopefully after practice it will bear positive fruit.
           </p>
           <h6>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h6>
           <p>
             I have not tried this yet and will probably get comfortable with the multiplying goodness meditation first before I attempt it.
           </p>
           <h6>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h6>
           <p>
             As far as Phase 0 is concerned I find that the SCARF model only applied partially because the majority of it was carried out in isolation. There was some opportunity for interaction during the check-ins and also the pairing assignments but I found none of the five domains of Status, Certainty, Autononomy, Relatedness and Fairness really came up. It will be interesting if this is the same for bootcamp but now that I am aware of them I will certianly look for them in my behaviour and others. I certainly can relate to the SCARF model in previous employment situation though.
           </p>
           <h6>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h6>
           <p>
             I did not really have the opportunity to have a difficult conversation and to be honest they are few and far between. I found the thought that impact is not necessarily intention a very useful concept and something that I will try to be aware of in future.
           </p>
           <h6>Any other musings?</h6>
           <p>
             I definetly found the "Search Inside Yourself" chapters that we have studied very interesting and I certainly want to finish the book and also go back over it and put into practice its teachings. I think it will benifit both myself and those around me if I can tap into the mindful mind.
