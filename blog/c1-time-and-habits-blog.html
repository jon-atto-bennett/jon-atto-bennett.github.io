    <h2>A look at ways to make the most of your time and develop habits to meet your goals </h2>
    <h3 id="center">2 December 2016</h3>

    <p>After skiming through the resources the first technique I tried was time boxing as it was suggested we only devote an hour to the task. I have flirted with meditation and mindfulness in the past but have never percevered with them.</p>

    <p>I found the concept of developing "tiny habits" very interesting, especially using current habits as triggers. Of course the whole thing around meditation and mindfulness is fascinating once you start to explore it.</p>

    <p>Timeboxing worked for me because I can easily become distracted. I have started to use the Pomodoro technique, feeling that 25 minutes focus should be manageable.</p>

  <p>I will experiment with all the techniques suggested to see which ones work best for me.</p>
