          <h3>Self-Confidence</h3>
          <h4>"Search Inside Yourself" Chapter 4</h4>
          <h6>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h6>
          <p>Self awareness is mindfulness about yourself, the ability to be mindful/aware of your strengths and weaknesses so that you can put your best foot forward in any given situation. It is being aware of feelings as they arise and making a conscious decision about how they match your intent. It is important to recognise that your expressed emotions impact those around you as well as yourself.
          </p>
          <h6>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h6>
          <p>
            I have been doing a body scan as part of the Headspace daily ten minute meditation. At first my attention would go to areas of my body where I was feeling something e.g. discomfort or an itch, but now I am starting to be able to scan through my body independently from physical sensation. This shows a seperation between attention and feeling and will allow me to respond in a mindful way,
            it feels very satisfying.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also tried journaling and at first found it tricky just not knowing what to write. Then I started to jot down my thoughts in a rough note form knowing that only I would need to understand them and things started to flow more easily. It felt good putting my thoughts down and then being able to review them again in a mindful way.
          </p>
          <h6>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h6>
          <p>
            I felt that this is a very important concept, emotions can be very tricky and how they come out is not always appropriate to a given situation. Being able to recognise emotions within yourself and deal with them in a positive way is a desirable goal. Also knowing that it applies to others as well is very important and will result in more benificial interactions. The analogy of the sky being the self and emotions, both good and bad, just the clouds passing by was very helpful in my understanding of the concept.
