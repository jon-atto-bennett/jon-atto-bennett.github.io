          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <h4>"Search Inside Yourself" Chapter 6</h4>
          <h6>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h6>
          <p>
            It looks pretty good, I personally feel much happier when I have a definite purpose with something to work towards. It can be something big like changing my career and becoming a web developer or something small like cooking a nice meal. I get definite
            satisfaction from doing something I want to achieve. I'm passionate about my family and doing things that will allow me to make the most out of having them in my life. I enjoy taking pleasure in all sorts of things I get too experience but do not feel driven to anything in particular.
          </P>
          <h6>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</h6>
          <h6>What are your core values?</h6>
          <p>
              I went through a list of over 140 values the majority of which I could relate to but I whittled it down to 5 for this exercise. They are achievement, balance, contentment, continuous improvement and creativity. I'm sure this list would change on any given day and personally don't feel you need to include particular values at the expense of others.
          </p>
          <h6>What do you stand for?</h6>
          <div class="list">
            <ul>
              <li>My children being happy and healthy</li>
              <li>Good relationships with family, friends, colleagues and strangers</li>
              <li>Fairness and equality</li>
              <li>The freedom to live life the way you want as long as it does not <br>
                  adversely affect others</li>
              <li>Responsibility for the world we live in</li>
              <li>Expanding experience and understanding</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h6> How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h6>
          <p>
            The resilience ideas were very interesting, I know I can see-saw between optimism and pessimism and will work at tipping the balance in optimisms favour. The meditation exercise was useful in helping me become mindful of the feelings of success and failure and how to experience them without allowing them to dictate my actions.
