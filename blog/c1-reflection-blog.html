    <h1>First Impressions</h1>
    <h2>A reflection on the EDA experience so far</h2>
    <h3>2 December 2016</h3>

      <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
      <p> The ethos of EDA is not something I have experienced before in previous learning or work environments but it definitely stikes a chord. The analogy of being a customer in the restaurant or part of the kitchen team expressed in <a href=https://vimeo.com/85001014>Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> is something I am familiar with through playing in bands, not all the members are of the same ability, have their own likes and ideas but in order to be a good band find a way to work together so that everyone gets something out of it.
      <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>So far all good, the set up at EDA seems to encourage us to succeed and have a great experience while doing it.</p>
      <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>I hope to be fully engaged in the culture, not to be afraid to ask for help or give it when I can.
      <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p>I suppose my initial expectation of EDA was to facilitate my goal of becoming a developer, everything I have experienced with EDA up to now has met that expectation.
      <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p>Definetly excited and yes nervous too, mostly the uncertainty of the unknown and if I'll be up to the challenges, but I'm going to give it my best shot.
