          <h4>A reflection on the EDA experience so far</h4>
          <h6>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h6>
          <p>
            The ethos of EDA is not something I have experienced before in previous learning or work environments but it definitely stikes a chord. The analogy of being a customer in the restaurant or part of the kitchen team expressed in Shereef's Fireside Chat is something I am familiar with through playing in bands, not all the members are of the same ability, have their own likes and ideas but in order to be a good band find a way to work together so that everyone gets something out of it.
          </p>
          <h6>What are your impressions?</h6>
          <p>So far all good, the set up at EDA seems to encourage us to succeed and have a great experience while doing it.</p>
          <h6>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h6>
          <p>I hope to be fully engaged in the culture, not to be afraid to ask for help or give it when I can.
          <h6>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h6>
          <p>I suppose my initial expectation of EDA was to facilitate my goal of becoming a developer, everything I have experienced with EDA up to now has met that expectation.
          <h6>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h6>
          <p>Definetly excited and yes nervous too, mostly the uncertainty of the unknown and if I'll be up to the challenges, but I'm going to give it my best shot.
