          <h3>Daily Mindfulness</h3>
          <h4>"Search Inside Yourself" Chapter 3</h4>
          <h6>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h6>
          <p>
            Unfortunately I have not been in a positon this week to formally practice mindful listening. I have however been able to do some informal practice and have found it to be rewarding. By giving the speaker your full attention they seem to unconsciously pick up that you value what they have to say and therefore become more open and in turn want to listen to you as well.This goes towards effective communication from picking up the right thing from the shops to understanding and being able to act appropriately on peoples feelings.
          </p>
          <h6>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h6>
          <p>
            I think all three techniques of listening, looping and dipping and should be applied together. So I will endeavour to practice all of them.
          </p>
          <h6>Any other musings?</h6>
          <p>
            I found the comparison of training the mind to training the body very interesting. Circuit training improves both strength and endurance by doing resistance and cardio. Where as focused and open attention during medatation train both the attention and meta attention, the ability to concentrate and to recognise when that concentration wavers. Although not specified explicity I can see that is what the speaker in the HeadStart meditation training is getting you to do by alternating awareness of how you feel emotionally and physically. Acknowledging your surrounding environment i.e. sounds and smells and then bringing the mind back to focus on your breathing. It is encouraging to hear that the default state of mind is happiness and definitely something worth achieving through meditation.
