          <h6>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h6>
          <p>
            My main trigger when programming is frustration when I can't get something to work after spending what I feel is too much time on it. The disproportionate emotions are anger, failure and the feeling of not being good enough. The flip side of that though is achieving a task and feeling elation and that I'm a genius. I think from what this chapter says is that all feelings are natural and it is how you respond to them that is the important thing.

          <h6>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h6>
          <p>
            I found reflecting on past incidents when I have allowed my feelings to effect my reactions very enlightening and I will definetely try in future to use the Siberian North Railroad method to regulate my response if I feel I am about to overreact. Also I will try and be more emphathatic to other people's reactions.
