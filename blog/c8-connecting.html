          <h6>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h6>
          <p>
            I have not conciously used the techniques but feel they are things that I have experienced in the past, both in working and personal relationships. I definitely see their value and will try in future to use them more actively.
          </p>
          <h6>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h6>
          <p>
            I have listened empathetically, but not consistently and I know I have sometimes been guilty of psychologising so I will certainly distinguish between the two now.
          </p>
          <h6>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h6>
          <p>
            I found it very useful in solidifing my own beliefs and feel that if only we could think this way more often the world be a lot happier place.
          </p>
          <h6>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h6>
          <p>
            At my last job my manager resigned and I was hopeful that I would be given a chance to replace him.<br>
            From my perspective I was a suitable candidate because of my knowledge and experience of the working environment. I felt I knew what worked well but also what was required to take the department forward and be more efficient, giving greater value to the company.<br>
            From the companies perspective I did not have much managerial experience and the department could benifit from fresh thinking.<br>
            I can see the reasonings behind their thinking and although at the time I felt very undervalued in retrospect I think I should of done more to put forward my case.
          </p>
          <h6>Any other musings?</h6>
          <p>
            Only that on a good day I have the ability to be empathetic, however it is something that I can improve on with practice so that it is more consistent.
