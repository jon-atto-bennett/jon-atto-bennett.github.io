            Emotional Intelligence is not a concept I have come across before and so I was very interested to read the first chapter of “Search Inside Yourself”. Its importance in being able to deal effectively with what life throws your way is clear and the fact that it is something that can be developed is very encouraging. I can see the benefits it has to offer both personally and professionally and I look forward to exploring it more throughout our course and hopefully beyond.

            Attention is definitely a skill I need to work on and I can certainly reflect on situations that have happened where I wish I had used the space between stimulus and response for a more positive effect. Focusing on our body to tune into the emotion makes perfect sense and being aware of that fact will hopefully get me on the road to being more attentive both to my own and other people’s emotions.

            Mindfulness is something I have looked into before because I have a habit of worrying more about what might happen rather than just focus on what actually is happening. Which can cause unnecessary anxiety and have a detrimental effect on those around you as well as yourself. I hope the ability to be more “present” will allow me to be more positive and so happier.
            I took the “easy” option on my two minutes of mindfulness and concentrated on my breathing. It is something I will need to work on as my mind naturally wanders but I definitely felt a calmness afterwards and will look to devote some time each day to it through meditation.
